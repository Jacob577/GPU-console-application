### GPU-console-application

##This console application was created in order to help me get my hands on the a graphics card of the 3000-series. I now got a RTX 3060 so it ended quite well.


This is a console app suppused to scrape inormation about modern GPU:s on amazon.com and furhtermore store in a SQL-database.
Information can be called for and there will be filters availible to sort information and compare GPU:s
